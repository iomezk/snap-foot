# snapcraft build files for Foot - a fast, lightweight and minimalistic Wayland terminal emulator
\
The configuration file path is /home/᚜user᚛/.config/foot/foot.ini

As of being an unconfined "classic" snap, it doesn't provide sandboxing.
Consider your Wayland compositor has control over the terminal emulator.

Also this snap allows to activate the terminal emulator by opening any character device: `xdg-open /dev/tty`
